# Explore the Iris Dataset Using KNN

# Controls
The user can control 
* the value of k in KNN
* the proportion of total data that is used in training

# Plots
* The two plots show the four parameters; the sepal parameters and the petal parameters (width and length for each)
* Different symbols are used for
  - training
  - testing
  - misclassified

# Experiment!
* Try different combinations of propotions of training data and k!  What leads to the most misclassifications?
